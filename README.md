  <h1>🎮 Defence System </h1>
  <h3>Technology : Java Swing 🕹️+ OOP Concepts🚀 + Observer Pattern🏁</h3>
  <p>
    This project is a simulated Defence System developed using Java and Swing, designed to manage and coordinate multiple defense units such as Helicopters, 
    Tanks, and Submarines. Each unit has its own graphical user interface and unique capabilities, including aerial strikes, ground firepower, and underwater operations.<br><br>
    At the core of the system is a Main Controller (Observer Pattern), which facilitates communication and coordination between the different units. 
    The controller monitors updates such as strength calculations, area messages, and broadcast communications, ensuring all units work together as a cohesive defense mechanism.

  <h3>✨ Project Highlights</h3>
  <ul align="left">
    <li>🎶 <b>Game-like experience</b> with sound effects</li>
    <li>🚁 <b>Helicopter, Tank, and Submarine GUIs</b></li>
    <li>🌀 Implemented <b>Observer Pattern</b> for real-time communication</li>
    <li>⚡ <b>Scalable OOP design</b> for adding new defense units</li>
    <li>💻 Combines <b>Java, Swing, OOP, and File Handling</b></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This project demonstrates my ability to transform <b>OOP principles</b> into a 
    <b>practical, interactive, and engaging software solution</b>.
